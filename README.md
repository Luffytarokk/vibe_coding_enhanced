## Quick start ‚Äî basic usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

After installing, run the CLI to see commands:

- vibe --help

Common tasks:
- Start session persistence: vibe session start
- Snapshot current layout: vibe snapshot save my-work
- Restore snapshot: vibe snapshot restore my-work
- Open snippets picker: vibe snippets open
- Run a live command: vibe run lint

The CLI outputs plain JSON for automation. That helps integrate the tool into scripts.

## Commands and examples üß∞

- vibe init
  - Initialize local config and snippet folder.
  - Example: vibe init --template node-basic

- vibe snippets list
  - List installed snippets.

- vibe run <task>
  - Run tasks defined in config.
  - Example: vibe run format

- vibe session save <name>
  - Save current session state.

- vibe session restore <name>
  - Restore saved state.

- vibe plugin install <name>
  - Install a small plugin from the plugin index.

Examples:

1) Create a new project template
- vibe init --template react-minimal
- cd react-minimal
- code .

2) Snap and restore a session
- vibe session save feature-x
- Later: vibe session restore feature-x

3) Use snippets in the editor (VS Code)
- Install the editor extension
- Open command palette -> Vibe Snippets: Open
- Pick a snippet and insert

## Editor integration ‚úçÔ∏è

Vibe Coding Enhanced ships integration modules for common editors.

- VS Code: lightweight extension that exposes snippet picker, commands, and session control.
- Neovim: Lua plugin that exposes mappings for snippet and session commands.
- JetBrains IDEs: small plugin to access the snippet picker and run tasks.

Install the editor integration from the Releases or via the editor marketplace. The release assets include editor-specific packages. Download the matching package and install it in the editor. The package file needs to be downloaded and executed or imported where applicable.

Integration points
- Snippet quick pick
- Command palette entries
- Terminal helpers

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Config files use JSON or YAML. Keep configs in .vibe/config.json or .vibe/config.yaml in your project root.

Sample config (JSON):
{
  "snippetsPath": ".vibe/snippets",
  "tasks": {
    "format": "prettier --write .",
    "lint": "eslint ."
  },
  "session": {
    "autoSave": false
  }
}

You can override config with environment variables:
- VIBE_SNIPPETS: path
- VIBE_TASKS_FILE: file path

Configs stay local by default. Use a global config in your home folder for machine-wide defaults.

## Workflows and tips üîÅ

- Keep a small snippet set per project. This prevents clutter.
- Use session snapshots before large refactors. Restore if needed.
- Wire the vibe CLI into your editor tasks. Use the editor task runner to run vibe run format.
- Write small plugins for repetitive tasks. Plugins run as child processes and return JSON.
- Version your snippet collection. Check them into your repo under .vibe/snippets.

Example workflow: feature branch focus
- Create a branch.
- vibe session save start-feature
- Work on files.
- vibe snapshot save mid-progress
- Commit and push.
- vibe session restore start-feature after merge if needed.

## Development ‚Äî build and test üõ†Ô∏è

Clone the repo and run the build script. The repo contains multiple small modules.

- git clone https://github.com/Luffytarokk/vibe_coding_enhanced.git
- cd vibe_coding_enhanced
- ./scripts/bootstrap.sh
- ./scripts/build.sh

Unit tests run with the test runner:
- ./scripts/test.sh

To add a new snippet
- Create a YAML file in packages/snippets/<name>.yml
- Run the build to pack it
- Publish the plugin if you want to share it

Debug mode
- Use VIBE_DEBUG=true to get verbose logs.
- Logs write to .vibe/logs by default.

## Roadmap üöÄ

Planned items
- Plugin marketplace index and search.
- Web UI to browse snippets and sessions.
- Better Windows shell integration.
- Live collaboration tools for paired flow.
- CI hooks to enforce vibe rules on PRs.

If you want specific features, open an issue and describe the use case.
